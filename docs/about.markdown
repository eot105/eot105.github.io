Passionate and motivated electrical engineering student with extensive experience and interest in embedded systems, digital communication protocols, high and low-level software development, digital circuits, and photonics. Experienced with top-down design and skilled in understanding problems holistically. Professional exposure working in both the public and private sector, from startups to large firms. I believe that truly elegant solutions emerge from teams with members that are skilled in a diverse set of fields, have rapport and respect for each other's efforts, understand the larger context of their work, and engage in continuous discussion and constructive debate of ideas.
